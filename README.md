This is my personal portfolio website!

I designed and coded this whole site, so I believe it can show my personality and style really well.

I'm currently actively looking for a front-end web developer position:
- remote
- full/part-time
- relocating to Edmonton, AB from Toronto as soon as the pandemic ends

## Built with:
- Vanilla JavaScript
- jQuery
- CSS3
- HTML5

## To-Do's:
- Additional features to provide better user experience
- I'm constantly looking for things to update in order to improve my site. Please have a look and feel free to reach out to me if you have any kind of advice or feedback.

Of course, let me know if you're interested in working together! (https://claudiaahn.com/contact)
